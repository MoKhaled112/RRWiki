    	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
    <p><span class= "gold">How do I set it so that only admins/mods can start battles?</span>
    <br>You can do that by allowing only a certain role to send messages in that channel.

    <p><span class="gold">Where is the weapon I won from my match?</span>
    <br>Era weapons can only be used if you already own the era it is from. Also, you can't equip it (it’s not a skin). It is automatically used randomly during battles.

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I add the bot to my server?</span>
    <br>Use <span class="code">?invite</span> or you can also click <a class="silver" href="https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=693167035068317736&permissions=523344&scope=bot" target="_blank">here!</a>.

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I add staff through the bot?</span>
    <br>The command to add staff through the bot is <span class="code">?staff add UserID/RoleID</span>.<br><a class="silver" href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID" target="_blank">Here's how you get someone's ID</a>.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I make custom eras/phrases?</span>
    <br>At this time there are no plans to implement that. It’s too big of an undertaking.

    <p><span  class= "gold">The bot is down!</span>
    <br>It’s more than likely just lagging. Give it a few minutes and it’ll be back to normal.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I buy skins and eras for real money?</span>
    <br>No, Rumble Royale does not have any form of monetization.

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I set up an automatic battle?</span>
    <br>First, make sure there’s a staff battle set up in that channel. Then run <span class="code">?automatic setup</span> and it will walk you through it.

    <p><span  class= "gold">I’ve opened so many backpacks and haven’t gotten an era yet!</span>
    <br>Keep trying. There’s a very small percentage of getting an era in backpacks. If it were easy to get them there wouldn’t be a point of continuing to play the game.

    <p><span  class= "gold">How do I unlock new eras?</span>
    <br>Any of the previous season eras can be obtained through backpacks. The current season’s era can be obtained by reaching 100,000XP in the Season Pass.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I give/send someone gems, gold or any cosmetics?</span>
    <br>No, Rumble Royale doesn't support gifting or trading any of its currencies or items and we don't plan on adding the ability to do so.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Why is an automatic battle not starting although it met the player requirement / the given time between battles has already passed?</span>
    <br>The bot starts automatic battles one by one globally across all servers, if there is a delay in a particular automatic battle it may be because there is another major automatic battle ongoing somewhere else.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I get items from the rumble pass after the season is over?</span>
    <br>No, the only thing available in the backpacks after the season is over is the given era.

    <p><span  class= "gold">I voted for the bot so why does it say I didn't and I can't claim my gems?</span>
    <br>Sometimes it takes a while for you to be able to claim it, try using <span class="code">?claim</span> after a few minutes. If it still doesn't work, feel free to open a ticket and contact us.<br> Note: You can vote once every 12 hours and the delay between vote and claim doesn't affect the time you have to wait to vote again.

    <p><span  class= "gold">Can I set up automatic battles in my server without becoming partner?</span>
    <br>Yes, if you have 1,000 members or more automatic battles are available to you. 

    <p><span  class= "gold">Where can I find a full list of commands or info about the bot?</span>
    <br>Run the commands <span class="code">?help</span> and <span class="code">?info</span>.</p>
